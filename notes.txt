coding: from complex to simple

start simple today

nil

x = nil

x = "hello conf"
(x is now a string)

TYPES
x was of Nil type
x now is of String type


if rand > 0.5
  x = nil
else
  x = "hello conf"
end

type of x = ? 
String? shorthand for "String | Nil"


"foo".upcase => "FOO"

"foo".does_not_exist (at runtime -> BOOM)
Error at compile time.. safe!

now what about 

if rand > 0.5
 x = "foo"
else
 x = 42
end

x.upcase 
# deal with complexity, support human errors

Error: undefined method 'upcase' for Int32
compile time x is (Int|String)

if rand > 0.5
 x = "foo"
 x.upcase
else
 x = 42
 x *= 3
end

# this is fine


# we have objects
class Foo
end

class Foo < Bar
end

class Foo
 include Bar
end


class Foo
  # local instance only
  @instance_var : String

  # shared between all Foo's
  @@class_var : Bool
end
